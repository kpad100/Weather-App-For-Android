# Weather-App-For-Android
Simple weather app for android. 
Used OpenWeatherMap API to receive current weather and 5-day forecast based on an entered zip code.
For 5-day forecast: displayed the high and low temperatures, and an image indicating if weather is clear, cloudy, snowing, foggy, raining, thunder storming, or misty
For current weather: changed the app background and displayed a funny quote based on the weather; 
  also displayed the current temperature and the time it was last updated (it would update every hour)
